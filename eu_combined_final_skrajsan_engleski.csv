AntićZoran,"Antić, Zoran",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1962,FOR,"I want to say that it is extremely good, or at least I have that impression, that the Ministry of Police is constantly improving the work of the police. In several amendments to the law so far, we have had new organizational units, new procedures, new mechanisms within the ministry, and step by step, the Ministry of Police is approaching the civilized values that we have today in the EU. This is, in any case, the fight against organized crime and corruption, it is greater security for citizens, it is working with local communities, institutional reform, and European integration. Of course, when it comes to European integration, opening Chapter 24, we have the obligation to carry out strategic assessments, primarily in the area of organized crime at this moment, but there is still much to be done on that path, and this law creates an institutional framework to implement all the obligations we have undertaken towards the EU and the integrations that await us in the best possible way."
BanacGrozdana,"Banac, Grozdana",Partija ujedinjenih penzionera Srbije,F,1951,FOR,"You have done this perfectly and in the spirit of the 21st century, which I am very pleased about, as you have aligned everything with the European standards that are necessary for us to progress civilizationally, of course."
FilipovskiDubravka,"Filipovski, Dubravka",Nova Srbija,F,1967,NEUTRAL,"When drafting the law, the Working Group also cooperated with many non-governmental organizations, trade unions, international institutions, and primarily with the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
IlićStošićBiljana,"Ilić Stošić, Biljana",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1964,NEUTRAL,"Despite the conscious disregard of the fact that the proposed laws are being created in line with the European agenda, disinformation is consciously being spread in the public about the alleged narrowing of personal and other rights of citizens, especially during the debate on the Law on Public Gatherings."
JovanovićNeđo,"Jovanović, Neđo",Socijalistička partija Srbije,M,1962,FOR,"Of course, this coalition and this government, as a responsible government, have done a lot; it has brought Serbia to the doorstep of Europe, through whose doors Serbia will surely enter, and there is no doubt that everything that was not done in the period from 2008 to 2012 has been done now."""
KovácsElvira,"Kovács, Elvira",Savez vojvođanskih Mađara,F,1982,FOR,"Madam President, members of the presidency, Mr. Minister and your associates, ladies and gentlemen, Members of Parliament, first of all, on behalf of the parliamentary group of SVM, I would like to commend the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) for their thorough work on the Draft Law on Police, taking into account the opinions of all relevant stakeholders, including the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the expert public. The aim here is precisely to respect the principle of equal access to employment opportunities, which is one of the activities of the action plan for negotiating Chapter 23 with the EU. It is significant that the Draft Law on Public Gatherings is aligned with the recommendations of the Venice Commission and the OSCE Department for Democratization and Human Rights, as well as with relevant conventions, the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU."
MarinkovićVladimir,"Marinković, Vladimir",Socijaldemokratska partija Srbije,M,1976,FOR,"I would particularly like to highlight your liberal stance towards trade union organization and a completely commendable attitude towards the Convention and the respect for Convention 87, Convention 98 of the International Labour Organization, and of course, the European Social Charter, which represents a condition sine qua non for the development of relations, interpersonal relations, and relations between management and employees within an institution, organization, or company. I must particularly emphasize that Serbia is the only country in Europe where a special collective agreement for the police is in effect, which is precisely the result defined through constant dialogue with police employees, aiming to achieve the best possible solutions and optimal functioning of the police, and the definition of a clear, good, and quality security policy, which is ultimately also a condition for a good economic policy, and a prerequisite for overall economic and social development. Such a thing does not exist in any developed EU country, nor in the USA."
MiladinovićStefana,"Miladinović, Stefana",Socijalistička partija Srbije,F,1981,NEUTRAL,"In Europe, there are different approaches when it comes to prostitution, ranging from complete criminalization, partial decriminalization, to full legalization."
MilićevićĐorđe,"Milićević, Đorđe",Socijalistička partija Srbije,M,1978,FOR,"In our opinion, this is the basis and prerequisite for the fight for a better and European future, and in that fight, in our opinion, the whole society should provide support. When it comes to the Draft Law on Public Gatherings, I would say that it is completely clear and evident that we have a more liberal law that is in line with European standards."
ObradovićMarija,"Obradović, Marija",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1974,FOR,"Of course, time brings new challenges and some new threats, but also new expectations from citizens. The working group wrote this law modeled after developed European countries, based on how they organized work in their security services. It is very important that police work is modernized over time and that European standards are incorporated into our regulations. New types of work are emerging, which are now being performed in completely different ways. Therefore, it is not clear to me, but we will discuss it further when we talk about the details, why there is so much resistance to a solution that is so well crafted, modeled after European countries that implemented it long before us and are now compelling us to adopt this type of law through European negotiations."
OmerovićMeho,"Omerović, Meho",Socijaldemokratska partija Srbije,M,1959,NEUTRAL,"The Istanbul Convention, the famous Council of Europe convention on combating violence against women and domestic violence, which Serbia ratified as the eighth country in Europe, explicitly requires member states and signatories to align their laws as much as possible. To interfere with these rights, I believe that the stance of the European Court of Human Rights must have convincing and strong reasons because that same court, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, always examines in the cases it handles whether, in applying laws that restrict the right to public assembly, the state acted reasonably, carefully, and in good faith."
RakonjacVesna,"Rakonjac, Vesna",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1967,FOR,"Constitution, strategies for improving the status of women and advancing gender equality, conventions on eliminating all forms of discrimination, UN Council resolutions, as well as the practices of EU member states, have been incorporated into provisions that contribute to improving the status of women in the security system. Additionally, the responsibilities of the Police Directorate are expanding to include the adoption of a strategic assessment and a strategic plan, introducing a model of a unified planning system that would ultimately lead to the full implementation of an intelligence-led policing model, which is part of the EU's recommendations in the context of Chapter 24."
StefanovićNebojša,"Stefanović, Nebojša",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1976,FOR,"We certainly need to promote such people and strive to support those who are here today behind me, who perform their duties with complete professionalism and who have participated in drafting the law. I’m not sure who, upon seeing each other, has been more exasperated since this is about the fiftieth version of the law we have worked on. But it has shown that we have been receptive to advice both from within and outside, including from the non-governmental sector, professionals, various associations, and, ultimately, the EU, to which we aspire. We have tried to come up with something functional, not to create a Frankenstein law composed of all sorts of wishes and desires, which the people in blue (police officers) would then have to enforce, while we all say, ""Great, we've passed a law they can't enforce."""
StefanovićNebojša,"Stefanović, Nebojša",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1976,NEUTRAL,"The migration wave, the threat to many countries from terrorism—even in the most developed European states where such situations are possible—demands absolute professionalism from those engaged in this work. It is simply impossible for someone from local political structures to interfere, as this would completely undermine not just this law but the general tendencies of the EU. People are elected in the elections, and in that system, it can function that way. However, in a system where you want to apply European standards, like those in Sweden, which is moving towards consolidation—for example, Sweden used to have a much larger number of police administrations, and now they are reducing them to just one—local self-government must accept its part of the responsibility. That's why we advocated, and I hope when it arrives, I should say, from the European Commission's opinion—since it has been ready for several months now—the new Traffic Safety Law, to give authority to local self-government to, in cooperation with the police, install surveillance cameras and speed cameras, because local self-government also has a say in this."
StefanovićNebojša,"Stefanović, Nebojša",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1976,NEUTRAL,"I have carefully read the EU reports on Serbia, the progress reports from 2008 to 2015, with a special focus on the police, judiciary, and everything else. These are statements where you can see that the EU thought the worst of Serbia, though it did not want to say so brutally, but almost brutally. This is what the EU says, particularly regarding the state of the judiciary, which was the most difficult and the worst, but, of course, also concerning all other elements. Regarding the polygraph, I see there is still a fascination with it. However, as for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in accordance with the law, we will continue to use this mechanism, just as all European police forces do, particularly the American FBI, which also uses it. This was also told to me by the FBI director, Mr. Comey, when he was here visiting, and they told me about the results and how they apply it both in recruitment and in the annual control of employees."
StefanovićNebojša,"Stefanović, Nebojša",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1976,FOR,"We worked on this law, consulted extensively, and largely due to the opinions of the European Commission, the introduction of this law before the National Assembly was postponed last year so that we could discuss it earlier. We were ready in June, but you know, if you want to follow the path of European integration, certain rules apply, and at that moment, you must play by those rules if you want to be part of a larger team."
StefanovićNebojša,"Stefanović, Nebojša",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1976,FOR,"Regarding the Ministry of Internal Affairs, through this draft law—through all three, but especially through the Law on Police—we felt the need to address problems pointed out by the citizens themselves, such as domestic violence, searching for missing persons, responding in situations of increased risk, and in cases where such requirements are part of the EU accession process, which is the intelligence-led policing model we aim to establish. We find ways to incorporate all innovations in a legally feasible manner, and for that, we are grateful for the cooperation and support we have received from the non-governmental sector, professional associations, the National Assembly, and all others who helped achieve European standards in drafting these laws."
StojkovićDušica,"Stojković, Dušica",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1979,FOR,"The Draft Law on Police was anticipated by the National Program for the Adoption of the EU Acquis, as previous governments and some former ministers of police failed to propose to the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia. Additionally, this law incorporates certain positive practices from EU member states, particularly those provisions related to improving the position of women in the security system, who today successfully perform their professional duties side by side. For the first time in police practice, new means of force have been introduced, such as tasers, among other means of force, bringing Serbian police closer to the standards used by police in EU member states. Only then will we come closer to the EU and truly implement the process of European integration as a serious country."
VukićVanja,"Vukić, Vanja",Socijalistička partija Srbije,M,1978,FOR,"The existing Law on Police was adopted in 2005, and after numerous amendments, it is time to adopt a new Law on Police, aligned with the current needs of the state and social circumstances, which primarily pertains to the EU accession process and the ensuing negotiations. Harmonization with EU legal regulations also involves defining the intelligence-led policing model, which is included in the EU's recommendations and is regulated by this law in Article 34. This has proven effective in EU countries, where it is an integral part of police equipment in all member states, and it is necessary to align this area with EU regulations."
VučkovićNataša,"Vučković, Nataša",Demokratska stranka,F,1967,AGAINST,"The three laws we are discussing today fall under Chapters 23 and 24, and everyone involved in European integration or following the negotiation process with the EU knows that these are the areas where we face the most obstacles. It is important to note that we have passed many laws in various areas that may have been good and received positive opinions from the European Commission, but in numerous areas where we have enacted new laws, the situation has actually worsened. We all praised the media laws when they were passed; they were highly praised by the European Commission, but in practice, in what is daily political practice, we constantly see threats to media freedom and the right to objective information. This has been one of the most serious criticisms in the European Commission's annual report on Serbia's progress for the third, if not fourth, year in a row, and it does not mention any progress."
ČapoDejan,"Čapo, Dejan",Liga socijaldemokrata Vojvodine,M,1978,NEUTRAL,"It is a good starting point and is based on the experiences of many laws from European countries that deal with this topic, but this infringement on the rights of others can be interpreted in multiple ways."
ČotrićAleksandar,"Čotrić, Aleksandar",Srpski pokret obnove,M,1966,FOR,"In fulfilling these tasks, this law regulates, emphasizes, and underlines that the police must act in accordance with both the laws we pass in parliament and the international standards in law enforcement that have been accepted, primarily by EU member states and the OSCE. With years of experience in this field, we say that this law is exceptionally democratic, European, and liberal, and we should be trusted on this matter because the Draft Law on Public Gatherings introduces a major innovation: apart from ensuring the right to freedom of assembly, it also stipulates that this right must not limit the rights and freedoms of other citizens, which is perfectly reasonable. These laws will contribute to further democratization of our society, transparency in the work of state bodies, the further development of the rule of law, the continuation of the fight against crime and corruption, alignment of domestic legislation with EU regulations, as well as necessary rationalization in public administration, and they will bring significant savings to the budget of the Republic of Serbia for all the aforementioned reasons."
ĐurovićAleksandra,"Đurović, Aleksandra",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1976,FOR,"A novelty in this law is the formation of a sector for international cooperation and European affairs, which is very important, especially in this period we are currently in. On one hand, we are obligated to align our legislation with the EU, and on the other hand, due to the migrant waves affecting this entire region, it is very important that such a sector has been formed. The Ministry of Internal Affairs had very significant results in this regard in 2015. We have seen that the European Commission has also given positive assessments for the action plan for Chapter 24, which, in fact, pertains to the work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs."
ŠaracSuzana,"Šarac, Suzana",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1981,FOR,"This law introduces a series of innovations in terms of the organizational structure of the police, its powers, rules for career advancement, employee performance control, new means of coercion, and a number of provisions that have resulted from alignment with regulations applicable in the EU."
ŠutanovacDragan,"Šutanovac, Dragan",Demokratska stranka,M,1968,NEUTRAL,"On the other hand, you have attempted to create a new model of policing in the local community, which is something generally accepted worldwide and defined in almost all police forces in Western Europe, but not in the way you have done, which is purely declarative and still fundamentally lacks any real connection with local self-government."
AleksićIrena,"Aleksić, Irena",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1978,FOR,"In conclusion, I want to emphasize that both laws represent a step towards aligning our legislation with EU legislation, which is very important, especially considering that this is a strategic commitment of this Government. More importantly, both laws are designed to exist in the best possible interest and to protect the interests of both this state and our citizens, and therefore, they should be supported."
DragašMirjana,"Dragaš, Mirjana",Socijalistička partija Srbije,F,1950,FOR,"Given the openness of the market and communication, this regulation is very dynamic, and it is no surprise that the rules are constantly changing and new laws are being enacted, which must be aligned with the state of advertising in the market, not just with the modern laws prescribed by the EU with which our legislation is aligned in the process of joining. In 2013, the European Community adopted an EU ICT security strategy, providing certain development guidelines. This law in this area represents our comprehensive alignment with the EU, but as I like to emphasize, it is not important because of the EU; it is important because of us. All such endeavors must primarily aim at establishing a unified, good, and quality system of public administration, a relationship with the citizen, and our protection, either individually or, in this case, the protection of the system."
JevtovićVukojičićMilanka,"Jevtović Vukojičić, Milanka",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1960,FOR,"This is a new law, and both laws are in line with the strategic commitment of the Government of the Republic of Serbia to harmonize our legislation with EU legislation."
LjajićRasim,"Ljajić, Rasim",Socijaldemokratska partija Srbije,M,1964,FOR,"Another novelty concerns, as I have already mentioned, the provisions on misleading and comparative advertising. These existed in the current legal proposal but are now more precisely defined here and fully incorporated from the EU directive. A new provision bans the advertising of electronic cigarettes, and for electronic cigarette advertising, the same rules apply as for the ban on tobacco and cigarette advertising in general, thereby fully complying with the provisions of the Council of Europe's Convention and EU directives. I have already mentioned that we have incorporated everything that will harmonize our legislation in this area with the EU, i.e., EU standards. Another reason is the usual one—when we are adapting and joining the EU, alignment and harmonization with EU standards are required. Here, we are fully aligned with the ICT system security strategy that was adopted last year. We are also aligned with the directive that will soon be adopted in the EU, which relates to network and information security, and the provisions of that directive have already been incorporated into the text of this law."
LjajićRasim,"Ljajić, Rasim",Socijaldemokratska partija Srbije,M,1964,FOR,"We have resorted to a solution, first of all, one that is present in all EU countries. On the other hand, we have adopted a solution that, in practice, allows the ministry responsible for these matters to have executive powers more effectively and successfully, while the National CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) has all these other powers regarding warnings, analysis, assessing the situation on a global level, and providing recommendations to all institutions in the country on what should be done. Thus, we will not resolve this dilemma with this legal proposal, and it will certainly remain. The representatives, or people who gave those suggestions to give CERT greater executive powers, will continue to advocate for that."
MarjanovićVesna,"Marjanović, Vesna",Demokratska stranka,F,1969,FOR,"The Prime Minister emphasized, among other things, that he needs a full mandate with the support of the people so that Serbia can be ready to join the EU as a partner in making difficult decisions and, among other things, to ensure respect for the civil sector, non-governmental organizations, and the media that write freely and enhance Serbia's reputation in the world. After the EU progress report, in the latest report, where it was clearly stated that the progress in the area of media freedom in the past year was zero, that is, no progress was made, one of the recommendations defined was the strengthening of independent bodies, particularly the Regulatory Authority for Electronic Media (REM). If this government is truly committed to moving towards the EU, this is one of the most important examples where it needs to prove it because if it does not, it not only undermines the independence of the regulatory body and casts doubt on its independence but also damages relations with the majority of civil society and, in doing so, violates the basic rules of the rule of law in Serbia."
OrlićVladimir,"Orlić, Vladimir",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1983,FOR,"Third, the importance of the international aspect was emphasized, both in the context of Serbia's European integration and in the context of interstate cooperation, which is certainly dictated by the dimension of challenges in information and communication security."
OrlićVladimir,"Orlić, Vladimir",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1983,FOR,"Also, I find it commendable that this is a good effort in further harmonizing our regulations with European ones, an important step on our path regarding European integration, but also equally important in addressing some significant practical challenges that were identified in the previous law, which is still in force. The harmonization and alignment of our legal framework with the European one have been carried out in the best possible way."
PešićOlivera,"Pešić, Olivera",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1979,FOR,The adoption of the Law on Information Security represents a step towards harmonizing the legal framework of the Republic of Serbia with the European Union in the field of the information society.
RadenkovićDejan,"Radenković, Dejan",Socijalistička partija Srbije,M,1971,FOR,"It is somewhat symbolic but above all fair that we will adopt a better law in line with the best EU practices that regulate advertising. This is the case in this proposal, and it is aligned, as I have already said, with the EU acquis, other domestic laws, and represents the fundamental systemic law in the field of security. We have used all available achievements; again, it is our fate to use the available achievements of EU countries, and we have sought the best possible ways to choose those most suitable for our country. Above all, in conclusion, knowing that any majority will hardly find more commitment to the reform and transformation of Serbia into a normal European state, as the best, we will continue to contribute to improving legislative activities."
RističevićMarijan,"Rističević, Marijan",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1958,NEUTRAL,"Also, I would like to commend that our law is more stringent regarding alcohol than many European countries, as in some countries, it is even allowed for hard alcoholic beverages, etc. Considering the mentality of our nation, I think this is not a bad thing; for us and the Russians, the rules should be stricter, given our tendencies to consume this ‘mučenica’ (homemade brandy), which is far more accessible and cheaper to us than in European countries."
StojiljkovićIvana,"Stojiljković, Ivana",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1981,FOR,"The new Draft Law on Advertising should address all the shortcomings of the current law, and what is also very important is that it aligns with EU directives."
StojkovićDušica,"Stojković, Dušica",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1979,FOR,"Two years ago, in the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, these laws represented progress in aligning with European standards and in fulfilling our obligations in line with the opening of Chapter 10 and the screenings conducted for Chapter 10 concerning the information society and media. These laws were the subject of a wide public debate that lasted for more than two years, and they were supported by the European Commission with a positive opinion and by all relevant international organizations and associations domestically and abroad."
TomićAleksandra,"Tomić, Aleksandra",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1969,FOR,"However, it is important to say that, given Serbia's path towards European integration and that the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) must be implemented, and we provide a report on this approximately every year, and the EU reports on our progress as well—on which step we have reached in the implementation and overall harmonization of European directives—it should be noted that the adoption of these three directives, which are relevant to this field, is very important. These are Directive 114 of 2006, Directive 33 of 2003, and Directive 13 of 2010. In conclusion, regarding this legislative proposal, it underwent a public debate almost a year ago, from January 3 to February 3 of last year, passed the European Commission’s approval, and there are good reasons for this law to be adopted."
ĐurišićMarko,"Đurišić, Marko",Socijaldemokratska stranka,M,1968,FOR,"Dear Minister, esteemed guests from the Ministry, fellow MPs, the two laws before us, according to the opinion of the Parliamentary Group Boris Tadić, SDS – Together for Serbia, Greens of Serbia, represent a good step towards regulating the legal system of the Republic of Serbia, aligning our regulations with European regulations, and, above all, should make life easier for citizens."
StefanovićNebojša,"Stefanović, Nebojša",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1976,NEUTRAL,"I would like to remind you that in many EU countries, trade union organization is not allowed at all, let alone striking."
StefanovićNebojša,"Stefanović, Nebojša",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1976,NEUTRAL,"In this case, we also have the Law on Records, which is currently under review by the European Commission, and the Law on Data Processing of Records in the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP), which will define who has access to the databases and data, how they are stored, preserved, and used."
VukićVanja,"Vukić, Vanja",Socijalistička partija Srbije,M,1978,NEUTRAL,"To achieve visa liberalization, allowing citizens to travel to EU countries without visas, technical conditions must be met. These include biometric documents, which began to be issued when Ivica Dačić was the Minister of Internal Affairs, and the necessary laws that need to be adopted are the Law on Asylum, the Law on State Border, and the Law on Foreigners."
ČomićGordana,"Čomić, Gordana",Demokratska stranka,F,1958,NEUTRAL,"Whether this year or next, with the same minister or another, it is only a matter of time. Still, it is simply part of the European changes regarding documents, and it is much more natural for the local self-government to handle driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, as it is closer to the citizens. This is a much smaller shock for many of us who do not know enough about how it is done in Europe, but it is good first for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is good for the members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is good for the citizens, and it is good to give local self-government what it can really do, which is to issue driver's licenses and vehicle registrations."
ŠormazDragan,"Šormaz, Dragan",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1967,FOR,"The rapporteur for Serbia in the European Parliament, Mr. McAllister, wrote a six-page report about us and received over 200 amendments in the European Parliament. If we all really want to go to the EU and not just talk here about whether this explanation is better and plead with the minister to accept our amendment to boost our rating, Aleksandar Vučić and the SNS will defeat you again, thoroughly, and because of such behavior, you will be severely defeated in these elections because you are neither behaving democratically nor in accordance with European values."
ŠutanovacDragan,"Šutanovac, Dragan",Demokratska stranka,M,1968,NEUTRAL,"From the experience of those working in the police, regardless of the declared or, let's say, legally proclaimed independence of the police in its actions, unfortunately, the police still have segments that depend on security services and are not completely independent. This is something the European Commission noted in its report on Chapter 24."
AtlagićMarko,"Atlagić, Marko",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1949,NEUTRAL,"The power of knowledge and education for the development of Serbian society, as well as for society as a whole, was best demonstrated by the famous German philosopher Leibniz, who said, I quote: 'Give me upbringing and education, and we will change the character of all of Europe in less than a century,' end quote. This openness of universities to all progressive achievements in education, both in Europe and worldwide, allows this, but only under the condition that the imperative of critical evaluation and the creative adoption of foreign ideas and models into one's pedagogical practice is respected, which requires, in a way, incorporating the European dimension of education into our pedagogical practice."
BogosavljevićBoškovićSnežana,"Bogosavljević-Bošković, Snežana",Socijalistička partija Srbije,F,1964,FOR,"Today is an opportunity to remember that the Bologna Declaration was signed by European ministers of education in 1999, with the primary goal of establishing a unified European area of higher education. For us, an additional motivation was the fact that we are applying for membership in the European Union, and in that sense, we want—and we are also obliged—to align our domestic regulations, domestic laws in all areas, including higher education, with European standards."

FilipovskiDubravka,"Filipovski, Dubravka",Srpska napredna stranka,F,1967,FOR,"I agree with your announcements that we have caught the last step with European countries regarding dual education, that informatics must be introduced in schools, and that if we did not introduce that subject this fall, it just wasn't set up correctly. However, I believe that this one year will provide a sufficient framework to assess the technical problems in schools, primarily to start teaching informatics next September much more prepared."
KarićIvan,"Karić, Ivan",Zeleni Srbije,M,1975,NEUTRAL,"The example of the Netherlands, a country with the most developed agriculture in the European Union, shows that it has banned glyphosate and thus placed its regulations above those prescribed by the European Union Commission. This tells us that it is possible to have stricter laws than those of the European Commission or the European Union. All green parties are against glyphosate throughout the European Union, and this issue has been particularly relevant in the European Parliament over the last six months. The World Health Organization associates this herbicide with a possible cause of cancer, and unfortunately, the European Commission has temporarily extended its use until December 31, 2017."
LaketićDarko,"Laketić, Darko",Srpska napredna stranka,M,1975,NEUTRAL,"The least significant reason for supporting this proposal is the fact that the share of people aged 30 to 34 who have higher education in the EU is almost one-third higher than in Serbia. With a share of 36.8% in 2013 and a noticeable increase compared to 2002, the EU still has not met its set goal, which is for that percentage to be 40% by 2020. In 2002, the EU had an average of 24% of highly educated individuals in that age group."

It fell short in everything except competing for European projects and in the number of implemented projects and funds received, but unfortunately, not in the results achieved by these projects."
ObradovićBoško,"Obradović, Boško",Srpski pokret Dveri,M,1976,AGAINST,"The statement on the compliance of the Draft Law on Amendments to the Law on Higher Education with EU regulations—does this state not have the right to pass its own laws? Does every law in the Republic Assembly have to have a statement of compliance with EU regulations? I protest against the imposition of laws from outside, against copying laws from the West that are imposed on this society and state, against the lack of alignment of these Western and European laws with our legal tradition, our history, our culture, our identity, our national interests, and everything else that should actually be in the foreground, not the European Union. This has been our problem for these 16 years, that the European Union is in the foreground while our national and state interests, our identity, our heritage, and our achievements are simply pushed to the background.

The European Union is more important to this Government than the interests of Serbian students, Serbian mothers, new mothers, domestic entrepreneurs, and everything else we have heard in recent days from the Prime Minister, who has not yet apologized for those unprecedented insults to all Serbian mothers and new mothers, whom he accused of taking money for having children."

I would like to quote a text by Vladimir Grečić, recently published in Politika, which received a lot of attention. It says that the number of people who emigrated from Serbia to OECD countries—these include Canada, the USA, and 18 European countries—was, on average, 226,000 per year from 2004 to 2013. In 2013, 45,000 people emigrated, and in 2015, we had a record with 58,000 people emigrating from Serbia.

I know that all this material from the SAA is over 700 pages long; I know it is extensive, but I expected that in this many months of waiting for the Government to start working and come up with proposals before the Members of Parliament, if not the minister, someone could have more thoroughly dealt with the Stabilization and Association Agreement and the National Program for the Adoption of the Acquis for the period from 2014 to 2018."

This means a lot of work has been done, especially when we talk about projects led by the ministry—18 projects are underway in cooperation with the European Union, totaling 17 million euros. Still, the Committee on Science and Education and the Committee on European Integration adopted the negotiating position for Chapters 25 and 26, which relate precisely to this area, which is a significant step forward and an indicator of the effort and dedication not only of the Government of the Republic of Serbia but also of parliamentarians."

This should be considered in a different period, but the fact that the European Parliament adopted a decision to ban surrogate motherhood at the end of 2015 indicates that this law would then be almost contrary to European laws. I would like to highlight that our Government, led by Aleksandar Vučić, and our Ministry of Health managed to stop the decline of healthcare from 2014 onwards and that through good reform laws, we have been able to make progress. As a result, we have improved our score on the European Health Consumer Index and achieved significant progress in three key areas: patient rights, treatment outcomes, and access to healthcare."

The previous practice was that procedures for medically assisted reproduction were only carried out at the level of tertiary healthcare, but in line with EU practices and laws, the position has been accepted that private practice should also be included in the implementation of this activity under the same conditions.

When it comes to the EU, the question always arises of when we are ready and able to say that their standard is not good because in these 17 years, we have not yet reached a point where we can say that one of their standards is good.

Furthermore, I must point out that you have written—yes, you wrote—that there is an obligation under EU directives, but we are not members of the EU, as you know. It says, ""The Republic of Serbia must ensure that all regulations in the field of biomedicine are fully aligned with EU directives."" We are not members of the EU. Yesterday, the National Assembly voted and adopted the Law on the Ratification of the Convention on the European Forest Institute.

The new law adopts the position that, under equal conditions, the space, equipment, and staff can perform this healthcare activity in private practice as well, which is common in European Union countries. Since the existing law was partially aligned with EU directives, and since the Republic of Serbia is obliged to ensure that all regulations in the field of biomedicine are fully aligned with EU directives, the new law has received a positive opinion from the European Commission and is fully aligned with EU directives.

There is no coincidence in semantics, in the meaning of words, in the names of certain things, and everything we do according to EU directives speaks for itself. Regardless of what the EU directives are, we should look at what is in the interest of the citizens of Serbia, and it is not disputed that these two topics are of significant interest to the citizens of Serbia. Here's what the European Parliament says—I will quote what Mr. Pavlović didn't dare to quote. So, the European Parliament, in the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World for 2014, in paragraph 114, clearly condemns the practice of surrogacy, stating: 'It condemns the practice of surrogacy that undermines the dignity of women, considering that her body and reproductive organs are used as commodities.'"

PavlovićDušan,"Pavlović, Dušan",Dosta je bilo,M,1969,NEUTRAL,"You mentioned, Minister, that there is a trend in the EU moving against this.

Surrogate motherhood is discussed in the European Parliament in the context of respecting human rights, and one paragraph concerning surrogate motherhood refers to commercial surrogacy. That is what the European Parliament condemns. Furthermore, there are countries in the EU—apart from Greece, the Netherlands, and Belgium are also countries where surrogate motherhood is allowed for altruistic reasons. In the Czech Republic, the whole matter is not legally regulated at all; the Czech Republic is also an EU member, and since it is not legally regulated, surrogacy for altruistic reasons is considered permitted."

French, Italian, and German companies that come to Serbia market their products specifically in the European Union. Thanks to smart investment policies, we have managed to significantly reduce our trade imbalance with EU countries.

For example, those who want to invest in agriculture would need an investment of 150,000 euros. With such support given to investments, like foreign investors, we will then have the opportunity to truly secure a future for those people, investing in goat farming, sheep farming, providing quality milk, through milk production—there is cheese, there is the Svrljig belmuž, these are products that can be marketed tomorrow anywhere in Europe."

The problem is that what is being done in Hungary is not being done in Serbia, which is the barrier to the massive influx of migrants coming to the territory of Europe. You even change laws to align them with EU directives. And in every law passed in the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, it states that it is being adopted according to an EU directive. Mind you, there is no other word, but the exact word—according to EU directives. Does the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia exist to pass laws according to EU directives, or can any current topic ever come onto the agenda of this National Assembly?"

I would remind the public and all of you, esteemed fellow MPs, that all those who carried out terrorist acts across Europe are migrants who passed through the territory of the Republic of Serbia. In that regard, believe me, it is not at all isolated in modern Europe. As you know, in all elections in Europe, this is an important and big issue; more and more, political options that warn of the dangers of the migrant crisis are winning and gaining votes. All of them can be returned here, as colleague Minister Stefanović says, by an EU directive that is not a directive, but I don't know what it is, and I don't know what the word 'directive' means in the Serbian language, except as an order from those who govern Serbia through a colonial administration that is in power here."

Because Greece is in the EU, and we are not in the EU, this could be presented to us as a condition or even blackmail on Serbia's path to the EU—that we must accept a certain number of migrants, that we must become the largest asylum center in Europe, and so on. Thus, the EU has a mechanism of blackmail and continuously uses it on Serbia's path to the EU. We are the largest refugee population in Europe at this moment. We know what that hardship is, and we have rightfully helped each of these people, but that does not mean we should allow ourselves to do everything according to EU directives, to be a mere colony of Brussels, to follow every command of theirs and thus risk the safety of the citizens of Serbia.

Of course, I have attended numerous conferences, and I haven't been satisfied with all of them—not all of these conferences have led to spectacular results, to be honest.

That's why we now insist that all laws take this into account—of course, the one currently on the agenda—because Serbia now has outstanding advantages, such as its geographical position, duty-free exports to Southeast European countries and Russia, excellent macroeconomic stabilization, successful fiscal consolidation, low inflation rate, an improved business environment, and we have climbed 44 places on the Doing Business list.

Unfortunately, the fact is that today the problem is neither the bats nor the birds from the wetlands; the problem is that you in the Government of the Republic of Serbia seem to be blind and deaf to these issues or have decided to overlook them to achieve everything you have set on your path to the EU. We are convinced that we will never enter the EU, and accordingly, we should pass laws that are applicable here, suitable for our citizens, and tailored to our needs, not dictated by the EU.

I remind you that in the last four years, the reports of the Commissioner have not been discussed in the National Assembly, although this is contrary to the law and the Rules of Procedure, and that we only considered different reports last month because these people from the EU forced you to do so. When it comes to the Law on Personal Data Protection, it is completely aligned with European regulations and the directive. What we, the Serbian Radicals, have pointed out and continue to point out when it comes to copying regulations and laws from the EU, is exactly what is happening with this mentioned law—the inapplicability of certain legal norms."

Therefore, those in power must say whether all of this or at least most of it, or this specific matter, which is indeed the intention of the EU, is not needed by Serbia, and we will not accept it, just as EU officials, or individual member states, say, 'It's no use to you, stretch yourself, Serbia cannot enter the EU because there is no enlargement.'

As stated then, the average salary of 320 euros—quote, 'it's better to have 500 than 320 euros,' because with a higher salary, it is easier to pay utilities, it is easier to pay for electricity, and the standard of living of citizens is better."""

However, on the other hand, we have managed to integrate these matters into our system through further negotiations with the EU, particularly in our energy policy, but also through certain investments in infrastructure projects supported by the Government of the Republic of Serbia.

This is of great importance to us because whenever we discuss matters with developed EU countries, as well as with the East and the West, you can see that many policies are being created.

And in opinion, you can make a serious offense, be punished without knowing why you were punished because, allegedly, someone didn't like it or because you might be slowing Serbia down on its path to the EU. Surprise, surprise, with all those fabrications, a few years ago, we ended up in the National Assembly with both a pro-EU government and a pro-EU opposition, and they began to be labeled that way.

Therefore, I suggest to the parliamentary committees and, of course, the future government of the Republic of Serbia to focus more on the topic of how we will preserve our relations with the Russian Federation on this disastrous path of Serbia to the EU at all costs, and not worry about the relations of the Serbian Movement Dveri with top Russian diplomats, with whom we have been friends for many years and who, of course, have repeatedly received the highest delegations of the Serbian Movement Dveri in Moscow, showing who the real partner of the Russian Federation is in the territories of Serbia."

The European Commission has never cured anyone, it has no stethoscope, no laboratory. The EU has been a disaster for everyone. All who supported the EU have failed.

Europe will not, and the European Central Bank will not, flood the market with cheap money and buy bonds indefinitely. However, I think there are a few more things that are very important to talk about, such as that if we could already get a tranche of about 180 million from the European Investment Bank to renovate courthouse buildings, introduce information systems, and make the judiciary function more efficiently, I think we could have considered getting support for a comprehensive reform of regulations in Serbia. Not in the sense of changing some key economic system laws—we have a timeline provided by the EU, and that path is clear—but to develop a clear study where we have many inconsistencies in laws, bylaws, ambiguities because that would be the greatest support you could give to the judiciary so that there are fewer cases due to a more coherent, clearer, and better legal system."

So, there is significant pressure from the EU to introduce their values into our textbooks and promote homosexuality to minors. I want to make a very important distinction here; I make a significant distinction between European values and the values of the EU. Dveri very much support European values and uphold them, but what the EU promotes as its values is simply not in line with the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, which states that parents have the right to raise their children according to their own moral and religious principles and have the right to decide what the content of textbooks offered to their children will be."

A secondary, but still important, reason is to harmonize certain areas not only with the Constitution of Serbia from 2006 but also with reality. For SVM (Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians) deputies, it is important that the law proposals prepared by the Ministry of Internal Affairs also follow the comments of the European Commission in the implementation of Chapter 24 – justice, freedom, and security. The reason why SVM deputies will support this set of laws is the fact that by introducing standards and aligning with the EU's legal frameworks in this area, the security of Serbian citizens will be increased, the rule of law will be protected, and Serbia will become part of a truly large system that addresses all challenges through information exchange and close cooperation with EU member states."

To begin with, even if only fictionally, we should respect our citizens, not the European Union, of which Serbia is still not a member and when it will become one or if it will become one, we do not know. However, we certainly know that it is obligated to sign a legally binding document and relinquish Kosovo and Metohija, or 15% of its territory. Therefore, we have not a single reason for every law here to be adopted following a directive of the European Union and due to alignment with the European Union. Obviously, this also takes into account some donations from the European Union, but it is indicated everywhere that 10 to 15% of these funds need to be provided by the local community.

Therefore, this reference laboratory in the Ministry of Internal Affairs has technical capacities equal to European and global standards and has the necessary minimum capacities for implementing this law, which deserves all praise.

They received all the praise from the Venice Commission and the European Commission. Now, Nela Kuburović holds public hearings and says it doesn't matter what lawyers say about these proposed reforms and future constitutional changes, which are increasingly being discussed because they are demanded as part of opening some chapter in the EU.

Then, there was a statement by NATO's commander for Europe that Serbia is the main problem in the Balkans, and tomorrow we have a visit from the new U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Asia.

For this reason, I also believed that the issue of social equality should be one of the key elements in the further work regarding NOKS. This may not seem directly related at first glance, but it is connected because qualifications obtained in other countries are not only from EU countries but also from the former SFRY, where many of our current citizens and those living in the Republic of Serbia have serious problems validating their diplomas appropriately to secure a proper livelihood, which is indeed one of the key issues of social equality."

The essence is to adopt ISO standards, European standards, to open this market for European products. What is needed for agriculture, all the materials and resources, are produced in Russia, produced, truth be told, according to their standards, according to GOST, not ISO standards.

Because of the EU, Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija are under some sort of siege by the Albanian police. The European Union is taking Trepča from us, leaving so many people without jobs, seizing the property of the Republic of Serbia. The European Union, when it comes to food, food safety, etc., is poisoning the citizens of Serbia."
RadetaVjerica,"Radeta, Vjerica",Srpska radikalna stranka,F,1955,AGAINST,"You say this law is being passed because of the market, and then you mention the Eurasian market, the EU market, the Turkish market, etc. Yes, for the market, but not for the market under some strict EU regulations and the EU market. Why does it have to be with Germany as an EU member? From everything you've said in response to my discussion, it's clear to you, too, that we don't need the EU in this endeavor, just as we don't need the EU at all. The European Union is evil."
RadetaVjerica,"Radeta, Vjerica",Srpska radikalna stranka,F,1955,AGAINST,"When we say something, we say it from experience, and we propose to you and the parliamentary majority to adopt our amendments so that there will be no more such experiences in the future and that we work in the interest of the state and the citizens of Serbia, not the EU. This harmonization of regulations is killing us because even this legislative proposal we are now discussing is a consequence, as you wrote, of the need for harmonization with the EU. But I ask you, what is the EU? If it is something, it is a graveyard of small nations, and we must never go there. As you can see, they are taking Kosovo and Metohija from us, taking Trepča from us, making some sort of encirclement around Kosovo and Metohija. If there is still anyone in Serbia, unfortunately still in power, who thinks we should harmonize anything with the EU, then we are in serious trouble."
RističevićMarijan,"Rističević, Marijan",Narodna seljačka stranka,M,1958,NEUTRAL,"Ladies and gentlemen, members of parliament, Serbia is not in the EU. Croatia, which is an EU member and whose unfortunate representatives are here trying to incite a revolution, members of political parties from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina come here, demand a revolution in Belgrade, but not in Zagreb.

SavićNikola,"Savić, Nikola",Srpska radikalna stranka,M,1959,AGAINST,"My amendment aligns with the SRS's stance towards the EU. We repeatedly warn you that not everything that comes from the EU is good and that much of what you propose and pass here brings harm to Serbia and the Serbian people. This was even confirmed by the President of the country and the President of your ruling party. I believe he said it in your town of Sremska Mitrovica, Mr. Minister, when he finally admitted to the citizens that the EU is a deception and an illusion. If you are so keen on the EU, then let's do what the Bulgarians and Romanians did before—adopt all those European laws without translating them into English, vote on them, and be done with it."
SavićNikola,"Savić, Nikola",Srpska radikalna stranka,M,1959,AGAINST,"This is yet another law being enacted at the behest of the EU, and the SRS constantly warns you that not everything coming from the EU is good for Serbia. As a rule, it is not good for Serbia, but you persistently push for these European laws. However, we know that today large quantities of food are imported precisely from those EU countries, even though the state of Serbia has historically been known as a self-sufficient country in food production and was an exporter of food."
ŠarovićNemanja,"Šarović, Nemanja",Srpska radikalna stranka,M,1974,AGAINST,"In this way, Mr. Marinković, there is a display of disrespect both towards the National Assembly and the citizens of Serbia, especially as you try to cram the EU into every law in every possible way, as if the EU hasn't already caused us enough harm. And as if, just a few days ago, high representatives from the EU, specifically from France, did not clearly and openly state that Serbia has no chance of entering the EU because the EU is facing problems and restructuring. How long will this last? Even if, God forbid, we fulfilled all the conditions—again, God forbid, because all these conditions are detrimental to Serbia—you still wouldn't be admitted into the EU because they do not want you there. So, you are the Government of the Republic of Serbia; your job is, first and foremost, to care for the citizens of Serbia, and if you do this properly, Serbia will be a happy and prosperous country, and we won't need that mantra that we'll live better when we join the EU, which I am fully convinced will never happen."

We should be enacting laws that are in the interest of the citizens of Serbia and that are applicable, rather than aligning our laws with European laws just because the EU demands it. Everything that the EU has imposed on us has been disastrous for the citizens of Serbia. That is why we continually tell you to abandon the disastrous path towards the EU, which we will never enter and in which we have no desire to be."

MijatovićMilorad,"Mijatović, Milorad",Socijaldemokratska partija Srbije,M,1947,FOR,"Second, regardless of what we are discussing here, we have a very significant fact: we are raising many issues that are crucial for Serbia, which aims to join the EU. This very fact suggests, and it is good that the majority of parliamentary groups do not dispute the issue of autonomy, but since we advocate for EU membership, there will certainly be many questions regarding all the chapters we are opening, particularly about the level of autonomy. In the EU, different levels of autonomy exist. My view, which aligns with the stance on European integration, is that money should be earned before it is spent. If this ruling coalition, which includes the Social Democratic Party, is interested in European integration and genuinely wants to be a part of the EU, then we will know how to solve all problems."
JevđićMarija,"Jevđić, Marija",Jedinstvena Srbija,F,1981,FOR,"When we talk about prevention and the fight against corruption, the JS believes it is one of the priorities in the reform process being implemented in Serbia on its path to EU membership. There are criticisms related to the fight against corruption that somewhat confuse citizens, but it can be clearly stated that the Republic of Serbia has been positively evaluated by the Anti-Corruption Body of the Council of Europe for adopting systemic anti-corruption laws and measures implemented in the state. This cooperation was reflected through a twinning project that lasted two years and was funded by the EU. Serbia has a European standard and demonstrates that it leads the region in combating corruption. When we speak of specific measures being implemented, we must mention the Whistleblower Protection Act, which was created following the highest standards of the Council of Europe, due to which many countries, primarily from Central Europe, are seeking assistance from Serbia in drafting similar laws."
RadetaVjerica,"Radeta, Vjerica",Srpska radikalna stranka,F,1955,AGAINST,"We are discussing the path to the EU, which we in the SRS believe is not good for Serbia, is not good for our people, and we repeat this stance.

Meanwhile, we have overtaken 14 EU countries. As for the EU, I advocated for it; my party, in its 1990 program—albeit a small party—highlighted the goal of Yugoslavia joining the European Community. Today, I advocate, and I hope to see, Serbia entering the EU, primarily because of the Common Agricultural Policy. For farmers to understand, if we were EU members, today we would have subsidies of 500 euros per hectare on average, not 100."
BojićDubravko,"Bojić, Dubravko",Srpska radikalna stranka,M,1953,AGAINST,"Ladies and gentlemen, members of parliament, speaking in the general debate on this Draft Law on the Dual Model of Higher Education Studies, I stated that it is a law for Serbia's European future, if and when it happens, but until then, this is a law on credit, on account. This is a law based on European experiences. Therefore, I want to underline that the SRS's principled stance towards the EU and this model of studying is negative because, above all, transplanting foreign experiences is neither appropriate nor applicable in our society and educational context. For something like this, there needs to be a state with a strong and developed economy, which is certainly not the case with Serbia."

JovanovićNataša,"Jovanović, Nataša",Srpska radikalna stranka,F,1966,AGAINST,"So, we have arrived at the crucial question, in addition to your desire to join the EU, which is falling apart and placing conditions upon us. First of all, most EU member states have recognized the fake Albanian state of Kosovo. The resolutions adopted in the European Parliament are aimed at constantly tightening the noose around Serbia's neck, and we simply cannot understand such a policy, nor do we believe that the majority of Serbian citizens can accept it. We cannot be an experiment for large EU corporations regarding GMOs."
NikolićRužica,"Nikolić, Ružica",Srpska radikalna stranka,F,1976,AGAINST,"The provisions of this article fully meet the criteria set by the EU directive, and it is evident—especially when it comes to this Draft Law—that it is a clear example of how we unconditionally accept everything the EU demands of us. Certain legal norms either begin or cease to apply upon Serbia's accession to the EU. I don't know what else is needed for you to accept the fact that we will never enter the European Union, something that we in the Serbian Radical Party desire and have been advocating for years, and that we should stop harmonizing our legislation with European standards. Because of this alignment, you should propose a new law that is entirely in the interest of Serbian citizens and can be applied immediately, rather than having provisions that only take effect or expire upon Serbia's entry into the European Union."
SavićNikola,"Savić, Nikola",Srpska radikalna stranka,M,1959,AGAINST,"These and many other issues have been inherited from the EU, and we constantly warn that everything that comes from the EU is not good, because we know that the West is the only civilization in the history of humanity that has had a destructive, devastating effect on all other civilizations it has come into contact with. Many things imposed on us by the EU already have their roots back in the times of Nazism, which is particularly visible in our education. We had a fairly solid education system, but under the pressure of the EU or whoever else, we agreed to something that is certainly not good."
StevanovićAleksandar,"Stevanović, Aleksandar",Dosta je bilo,M,1976,FOR,"So, we have two laws that explicitly address this and respond to some challenges that have emerged over the years of Serbia's European integration, as well as during the practical problems that exist because accounting is quite a dynamic matter. It has occasionally been extremely dynamic here when we had, in my opinion and the opinion of the majority, too many account frameworks, but things are moving in a better direction, and it is important to continually align with European directives to one day become part of the European market under the best legal system we have ever had, I am convinced of that. That is why we in the SMS parliamentary group always wholeheartedly welcome everything related to meeting the criteria of the EU accession chapters. Continuous compliance and monitoring of what the EU adopts—because, as they say, only when everything is harmonized can we talk about the ratification process."
SavićNikola,"Savić, Nikola",Srpska radikalna stranka,M,1959,AGAINST,"About a month or two ago, maybe three at most, the Council of Europe adopted some recommendation or declaration—whatever it is called—related to history textbooks, suggesting a common history textbook for European nations.

We warned about something that could be seen from the news present yesterday—that Serbia would implicitly recognize Kosovo's independence this way, as these are the positions of some European diplomats as well as the official authorities in Macedonia and Albania. So, we think this is a foreign policy mistake we should abandon, not delve further into it, and stop the practice of fulfilling everything demanded of us in cooperation with the EU.

However, one major aspect that these proposed amendments and additions to the law do not address, which affects about 10% of the population in Serbia, is the issue of accessibility based on the principles of universal design. So, regarding these amendments being discussed today in the Assembly, I can say that the Modern Serbia Party always supports everything related to Serbia's accession to the EU and European integration because we believe that Serbia's accession to the EU is indeed the only correct and right path to solve the numerous difficulties we face in our country. We consider that joining the EU is the best mechanism for this."

So, I really believe, and I once again commend this work, that we, the members of parliament, are indeed responsible for this. I regret hearing criticism on this topic from fellow members of parliament. Some of the amendments related to this draft law are also about aligning with EU regulations. What is interesting to mention here is that these amendments are intended to take effect only when Serbia joins the EU. Regarding the amendments to the law before us today, we have many provisions that concern alignment with EU regulations."

Why don't we ask the citizens now in the elections to vote in a referendum to decide whether we want to join the EU without Kosovo and Metohija as part of the Republic of Serbia?"
